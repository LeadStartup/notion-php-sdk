# Notion PHP SDK

This is an unofficial PHP SDK for Notion, based on the great earlier work of @jamalex on [notion-py](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py)

## Installation

```
composer require madewithlove/notion-php-sdk
```

## Usage

For now check the `examples` folder to see the client in use. This section will expand once the API stabilizes a bit.
